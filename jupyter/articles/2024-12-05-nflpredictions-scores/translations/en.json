      "## What’s This About 🤔\n",
      "\n",
      "Welcome to *Finding NFL Winners*, a series where we dive into what it takes to predict **NFL game outcomes**. In this first part, *The Record*, we’ll explore how the team seasonal record impacts the likelihood of winning games.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the series unfolds, we’ll develop tools and eventually create a predictive model to answer the ultimate question: *Who’s going to win?* Let’s get started!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Disclaimers\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I’m relatively new to American football, with just three years of watching under my belt. While I still have plenty to learn, this fresh perspective allows me to focus solely on the numbers, free from bias.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, although I’ll reference Vegas odds in my analysis, I strongly discourage gambling. It’s addictive and harmful. This series is about understanding and predicting the game—not betting on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "In this article, we explored whether a team's season win and loss **record** can predict game outcomes. In the end, we built a very simple ML model that predicts winners with **80%** accuracy, covering about 40 cases per year."

The dataset contains **372 columns** of play-by-play data, spanning from **09/12/1999** to **11/29/2024**, with a total of **26 seasons**, **6,886 games**, and **1,211,926 plays**.\n",

      "When it comes to predictions, most ML models are built to compete against Vegas lines. But why fight it when we can embrace the wealth of information Vegas provides? Sure, there are tons of bookies offering different odds, and public betting probably skews the lines. But for this analysis, the spread line from [Pro-Football-Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/) should do just fine. It gives us a solid baseline for how accurate Vegas can be and sets the stage for some exciting comparisons.\n",

Miami was riding high at 9-3, while the Titans were struggling at 4-8. Vegas gave Miami a 14-point spread, but we ended up losing 28-27.
