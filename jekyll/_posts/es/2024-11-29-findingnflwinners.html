<h2 id="What%E2%80%99s-This-About"><a class="anchor-link" href="#What%E2%80%99s-This-About">What’s This About</a></h2><p>Welcome to <em>Finding NFL Winners</em>, a series where we dive into what it takes to predict <strong>NFL game outcomes</strong>. In this first part, <em>The Start</em>, we’ll explore the data to uncover which stats truly matter. Are turnovers, yards, or something else the key to victory?</p>
<p>As the series unfolds, we’ll build tools and eventually create a predictive model to tackle the ultimate question: <em>Who’s going to win?</em> Let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="Disclaimers"><a class="anchor-link" href="#Disclaimers">Disclaimers</a></h3><p>First, I’m relatively new to American football, with just three years of watching under my belt. While I still have plenty to learn, this fresh perspective allows me to focus solely on the numbers, free from bias.</p>
<p>Second, although I’ll reference Vegas odds in my analysis, I strongly discourage gambling. It’s addictive and harmful. This series is about understanding and predicting the game—not betting on it.</p>
